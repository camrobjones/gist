Ideas
-----

- LLM attention visualizer [ ]
- Sentence parser
    - type in a sentence and see
        - syntactic parse [ ]
        - similar words in space [ ]

git clone https://github.com/stanfordnlp/glove
cd glove && make
./demo.sh

- parameterize embeddings [X]

    - glove
        - don't double include words [X]
    - linebreak flex [X]

--

- refactor to use classes [ ]
- refactor creation
    - write a plan for how to run, store, load etc models
        - like a filesystem convention? a DB?
        - Or is this all putting structure before content? Like get a v0 working with minimal structure then plan & refactor before release?
    - section for models
    - create_and_save_embeddings()
        - separate file?
    - load_embeddings
    - load_wordlist
